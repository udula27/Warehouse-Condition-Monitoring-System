# Warehouse-Condition-Monitoring-System
This repository contains the PCB design, enclosure design and the code for a device that we created for monitoring the condition inside warehouses.The device was designed to measure the temperture and humidity inside a storage environment and provide real time feedback to the users through a dashboard. We utilized an ESP32 microcontroller to achieve this and following is the design of the PCB.

We also created a robust and moldable enclosure to house this PCB.
